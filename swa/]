Research Question
===========================
This paper seeks to answer the following questions:

+ What are the potential and limits of bottom-up models such as MAS to explore
the functioning of agricultural systems, in particular farm differentiation and
rural credit systems?

+ What are the potential and limits of MAS models to support a bottom-up
modelling approach, i.e. a participatory modelling process in which models are
conceived and used with and for local stakeholders?

Even if these questions are taken on face value, the methodology employed by the
paper is inadequate to answer them. The questions concern an entire modelling
discipline (MAS), yet this paper deals with a sample of *n*=1. Whatever
experiences the authors had with their particular modelling exercise---good,
bad, or otherwise---one cannot
make general claims about MAS based on that particular exercise. 

Moreover, these are questions but they are not *research* questions.
