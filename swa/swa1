Research Question
=====================

Like most papers we have read in this course, this one does not have a
research question. I would characterize the paper as more of an engineering
document than an scientific publication. This is not a criticism: it describes
a useful technical solution to an important real-world problem. But it does not
develop or test falsifiable hypotheses, the Popperian *sine qua non* of
science.

Model Effectiveness
=====================

This model is intellectually interesting and well-designed, but judging its
effectiveness is not possible by any rigorous criteria.

The model does many things well. It offers a convincing theoretical exploration
of the non-linearity and structural instability of crowd behavior, which
justifies the individual agent-oriented nature of the model. It builds a simple
structure---essentially, random walk with ant colony-style swarming
behavior---that nevertheless produces interesting emergent behavior and
macro-structure. It is well-documented, offering both programming-style
flowcharts of model logic and detailed mathematical description of behavior. The
model is well-designed as a policy tool, as it explicitly allows for the
introduction of policy interventions---e.g., different configuration of entry
and exit points, crowd control set-ups, and the like---and observing the effect
on crowd flows. The paper's references to various planning committees and
decisions suggests that the model was found believable and useful by
non-technical decisionmakers, which is no small feat. Also, the early
publication date of this paper (2002) makes all of the above even more
impressive.

However, the reader has no intellectual basis for ascertaining whether the model
actually works or not. The authors mention competing theories and models of crowd behavior,
but do not 
attempt to compare this model's performance to them by some common measure. Is this model
better or worse than Borgers and Timmerman (1986)? How about Kirchner and
Schadsneider (2002)? We do not know. The authors also did not
validate their model against real-world data. They did use data to tune input
parameters, but then did not take their tuned model and apply it some other
dataset. This distinction between training and testing sets is critical. It
is easy to over-fit models to one idiosyncratic dataset, when the goal is to
capture the true nature of some broader phenomenon. I do not
necessarily fault the authors for these choices because the motivation for their
model is engineering good policy, not conducting science, 
but it does mean that the reader has no real
basis for judging the model's performance.

Course Themes
=============================

While not a formal course theme, I think the following merits extended
discussion:
who is using agent-based models to do meat and potatoes science? We have conducted a
wide-ranging literature review of spatial agent-based modeling, and I can count
on one hand the number of papers that would meet the classifical definition of
competing hypotheses compared and tested by their ability to explain empirical
phenomena. Some models merely assess
qualitative correspondence to theory (which is fine - this is a useful activity
for theory development);
others, such as this model, fit their model to empirical data but do not compare
that performance to competing models (again, fine as a first-order sanity
check); very few have taken agent-based model A and stacked it up against agent-based
model B in terms of performance on some common empirical dataset. To continue
the food metaphor, I would characterize the
former two as "appetizers" and the latter as the "main course": some
theory-building and calibration is well and good, but really exists in order to
enable the comparison of competing hypotheses, and this final step is mostly
absent in the ABM literature. I believe the root
cause of this lies in the "one-off" nature of many ABMs, which I have mentioned
before. For whatever reason---the still-incipient nature of ABM;
inter-disciplinary boundaries; professional and publication incentives---most
authors do not compare the performance of their model to that of other models
(ABM or not). This is something that we should aspire to change as emerging
scholars in the field.
