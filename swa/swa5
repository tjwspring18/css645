Research Question
=================================
This paper does not have a research question, but it does have a clearly
stated purpose: to build a model capable of predicting cowbird movement patterns
in a specific geographic region so as to aid development of better trapping
strategies. This clarity of purpose contributed to a focused and well-posed
research effort.

Model Effectiveness
==================================
I judge that this model is highly effective.

First, a brief description of the model. There are three main agent types: feeding
areas (immobile), cow herds (mobile), and cowbirds (mobile). Feeding areas have
attributes that make them more or less attractive for grazing. Herds choose
feeding areas based on those attributes and some simple logic (e.g., avoid
recently-used areas, prefer near locations over far, and so on). Cowbirds search
for herds. Optimal trap placement thus can be determined by placing them at the
areas of greatest cowbird density.

One, this model is effective because we have a standard by which to measure it.
The model's goal is to help catch cowbirds; model-generated strategies do so at a 42% greater rate
than prior, non-model-based strategies; ergo, the model is effective. Such focus
is a contrast to some other models surveyed in this course that are paired with
vague, non-measurable, non-falsifiable research goals (e.g., "explore the
potential of MAS...").

Two, this model is effective because we can understand it. The documentation is
extensive and clear. Key parameters are identified and their values are backed
by theory and empirical evidence. Sensitivity analyis reveals the effect of
changing model elements. Verification and validation is conducted.

Three, this model is effective because it is well-suited for the problem at
hand. I discuss this in greater length below, but this model is a great
advertisement for ABM-GIS integration because integrating the two is not just a
"science project" done for the fun of it, but because the
research goal cannot be achieved without integration.

Course Themes 
==================================

I focus on only one topic in greater depth: ABM-GIS integration. Counterfactuals
are a good way to illustrate why both modeling paradigms were needed to achieve
research goal. Consider a purely ABM approach. Because the location of cowbirds
depends on the location of cows depends on specific geographical features,
knowing the decision rules of agents would be useless if they were not paired
with accurate information on the geographic features driving those decisions.
Conversely, consider a purely GIS approach. Knowing the location of geographic
features is irrelevant if they are not coupled the phenomena we actually are
interested in (cowbird movement). Clearly, both elements are needed.
